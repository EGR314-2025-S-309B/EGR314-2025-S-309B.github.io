Its motorized spinning mechanism, powered by a removable battery, ensures smooth and stable operation. There are adjustable PCB slots to ensure weight is distributed across the top to keep it balanced. The inner shell houses PCB components and ribbon cable slots, ensuring secure connections and minimal interference during operation. The motor at the base provides a user controlled speed, keeping the top upright and balanced. To enhance durability and safety, the exhibit features a wireless human-machine interface (HMI), allowing users to control the top remotely keeping it safe but still interactive. There are a couple of buttons to navigate the screen and monitor real-time speed data through a two-way internet connection, as well as control the motor on the top. We wanted to keep the controls simple to limit any learning curve for the users. An integrated gyroscope tracks rotation speed, providing data to the user and encouraging them to analyze how different speeds affect stability. Users will also be provided with labels and a basic tutorial on each HMI button and how to operate it. This will allow for simple and effective control between the users and exhibit. With its eye-catching motion, simple controls, and educational focus, the Spinning Top Interactive Exhibit offers a safe and engaging way to explore STEM concepts through real-world physics applications.</p>"},{"location":"Ideation-and-Concept-Generation/#presentation","title":"Presentation","text":""},{"location":"Innovation%20Showcase%20Poster/","title":"Innovation Showcase Poster","text":""},{"location":"Innovation%20Showcase%20Poster/#innovation-showcase-poster","title":"Innovation Showcase Poster","text":"<p>PDF</p>"},{"location":"Reflection/","title":"Reflection","text":""},{"location":"Reflection/#lessons-learned","title":"Lessons Learned","text":"<p>Throughout working on this project, there are many key things we learned, both from a technical and professional standpoint, that are important for any engineer. These lessons are listed out below.</p> <ol> <li>Clarifying requirements: While working thorugh this project, we learned that having clear constraints and goals is important when planning what visions and ideas you have for a project. Having clear requirements allows you to keep your project on track and results in less backtracking.</li> <li>Time Management: Having good time management and ensuring deadlines are being met is a required part of any project. It is important to always know where you aree at in your project and what goals you need to meet, as well as how much time you have to meet these goals. It can be benificial to have a designated member that is in charge of tracking these deadlines.</li> <li>Team Collaboration: Having solid team cohesion is a major part of having the project as a whole run smoothly. It is important that if you are having issues within your team that you address them appropriately and do not let any issues fester within your group.</li> <li>Communication: Along with collaboration, communication is also important when you are in a team project. Make sure to always express any issues or comments you may have about the project so that you can receive assistance or guidance. This will help when it comes to ensuring you have the best possible results.</li> <li>Documentation: Noting down and taking pictures of your project as you move through the different steps is very important. This allows you to be able to go back and see what works, so when something breaks, you can always replicate your results.</li> <li>Flexibility: Being able to adapt and change your project on the fly is very important. With how fast some aspects of the project can change in the classroom, it is always important to stay updated and be able to make necessary changes as quick as possible.</li> <li>Testing: Testing your project at every stage is necessary, especially when designing PCBs and coding. Verifying what parts of your systems are working individually and when connected with other systems will allow you to track progress better and improve the troubleshooting process.</li> <li>Learning From Mistakes: Being able to learn from mistakes you make during the design process is very important. This allows you to not only improve those mistakes on the current project, but also carry that information on any further projects you may work on for the rest of your career.</li> <li>Quality Over Speed: Especially when deadlines are approach quickly and tensions are high, it can be easy to rush through work and make mistakes. It is important to remember that rushing can cause issues in your project that can be detrimental, so make sure to still double-check all of your work and put quality work forward.</li> <li>Accepting Feedback: When working through any project that has a user or oversight by a teacher or project manager, it is important to be able to take feedback and use it to improve the project. If there is feedback you don't understand or have questions about, make sure to get clarification so you can make the best possible project for the user group.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"Reflection/#recommendations-for-future-students","title":"Recommendations for Future Students","text":"<ol> <li>Make a folder just for the class/project. This will help once you need to find certain files or code when using information from labs and implementing it into your projects.</li> <li>Have designated roles in your team. This will allow you to keep all members accountable and make sure everyone is participating, as well as making sure no one is falling behind in their duties.</li> <li>Utilize help from the teaching team. The teachers for the class have been operating the class for years and have seen many of the pitfalls you may fall into while working through the project. Not only that, but the TAs have also taken the class and know the frustrations you may be facing. Communicating with the teaching team often will help you immensely while working through the project.</li> <li>Document everything. Many issues will pop up as you work through making your system. Make sure to track every step of your project as you work through it so you always have something to refer back to.</li> <li>Lastly, learn to take your time. Especially in as intensive a class as EGR304/314, it can be easy to become frustrated and make stupid mistakes. Learn to breathe, take a step back, and take a calm and composed approach to whatever issues you may be facing.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"Resources/","title":"Resources","text":""},{"location":"Resources/#cad-files","title":"CAD Files","text":"<p>Human Machine Interface CAD File</p>"},{"location":"Resources/#final-systems","title":"Final Systems","text":""},{"location":"Resources/#human-machine-interface","title":"Human Machine Interface","text":""},{"location":"appendix/","title":"Appendix","text":""},{"location":"appendix/#appendix-a-team-organization","title":"Appendix A - Team Organization","text":"<p>Team Goals</p> <ul> <li>Develop a fully functional prototype that meets all project requirements and specifications for the innovatoin showcase.</li> <li>Complete all project milestones on time, including research, design, testing, and final delivery.</li> <li>Design a product that meets the requirements of us and our users.</li> <li>Make sure the product is practical and usable for our users.</li> <li>Design a product that encourages STEM based thinking for K-12 students.</li> </ul> <p>Class Goals</p> <ul> <li>Create a project that can be showcased in personal portfolios.</li> <li>Gain hands-on ecexperien in engineering principles, project management, and teamwork.</li> <li>Use this project as a stepping stone to internships, jobs, or graduate school applications.</li> <li>Develop skills and experiences that will be valuable in real-world engineering careers.</li> <li>Grow and develop new skills with professional engineering software.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"team-organization/","title":"Team Organization","text":""},{"location":"team-organization/#team-charter","title":"Team Charter","text":"<p>Our team is dedicated to creating a working prototype that meets the project goals and helps us grow as engineers by building real-world skills and preparing for our future careers.</p> <p>We came up with this statement by focusing on our top priorities as a team.
