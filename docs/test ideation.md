## About Our Exhibit

Goal of our Exhibit

We want our exhibit to inspire future STEM students by showcasing the real-world capabilities of STEM concepts through a fun and interactive experience. To achieve this, our design focuses on engagement, creativity, and hands-on learning, ensuring that visitors are not only exposed to STEM principles but also actively participate in applying them. We aim to make STEM ideas accessible, exciting, and easy to explore, and we want to encourage a curiosity and problem-solving mindset with our users.

Target Audience

For this project, we believe that our target audience is going to be high school students and some adults with a basic high school education. Since our showcase will be with ASU, the audience will have a varying amount of people with different backgrounds and involvement with the school. Most of the users will have done many projects or designs similar to what we may have, but we hope to get some younger users as well.

## Idea Generation

For our initial idea generation, we were focused mostly on generating ideas that seemed fun or interesting to our audience of high school students. This includes things that are very interactive, visually interesting, or simply just cool looking. We wanted things that can catch the eye of this audience to entice them to view our exhibit.

The Spinning Top Interactive Exhibit is designed to engage users with an interactive demonstration of balance, motion, and physics principles. Its motorized spinning mechanism, powered by a removable battery, ensures smooth and stable operation. There are adjustable PCB slots to ensure weight is distributed across the top to keep it balanced. The inner shell houses PCB components and ribbon cable slots, ensuring secure connections and minimal interference during operation. The motor at the base provides a user controlled speed, keeping the top upright and balanced. To enhance durability and safety, the exhibit features a wireless human-machine interface (HMI), allowing users to control the top remotely keeping it safe but still interactive. There are a couple of buttons to navigate the screen and monitor real-time speed data through a two-way internet connection, as well as control the motor on the top. We wanted to keep the controls simple to limit any learning curve for the users. An integrated gyroscope tracks rotation speed, providing data to the user and encouraging them to analyze how different speeds affect stability. Users will also be provided with labels and a basic tutorial on each HMI button and how to operate it. This will allow for simple and effective control between the users and exhibit. With its eye-catching motion, simple controls, and educational focus, the Spinning Top Interactive Exhibit offers a safe and engaging way to explore STEM concepts through real-world physics applications.
