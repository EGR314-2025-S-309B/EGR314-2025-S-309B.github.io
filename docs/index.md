## Intro

This website provides documentation for an embedded systems project. The project is a spinning top designed to provide a fun and interesting way to get high school students interested in STEM. This website is meant to document the ideas and decision making process of our team throughout the projects timeline. We also have individual websites to document our individual systems and provide more information for each section of our project.

## Project Description

This project is centered around creating a fun and interactive device for k-12 users to become interested in STEM. To do this we used an interactive spinning top system that uses sensors, wireless communication, and a digital display to engage users in a playful and educational experience. The top transmits data such as spin rate and motion via MQTT to a dashboard, where users can visualize its behavior in real time. This fusion of physical motion and digital feedback aims to spark curiosity in physics and engineering principles, making abstract STEM concepts more tangible and engaging through hands on interaction.
